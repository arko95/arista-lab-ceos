# Topology file

Topology file is a YAML file describing how docker containers are to be interconnected.
This information is stored in the `links` variable which 
contains a list of links. Each link is described by a unique set of connected interfaces. 
There are several versions of topology file formats. 

## Topology file v1
This version is considered legacy and is documented [here](https://github.com/networkop/docker-topo-topo/blob/master/v1.md). 

## Topology file v2
Each link in a `links` array is a dictionary with the following format:
```yaml
VERSION: 2
links:
  - endpoints:
      - "Device-A:Interface-2" 
      - "Device-B:Interface-1"
  - driver: macvlan
    driver_opts: 
      parent: wlp58s0
    endpoints: ["Device-A:Interface-1", "Device-B:Interface-2"]
```
Each link dictionary supports the following elements:

* **endpoints** - the only mandatory element, contains a list of endpoints to be connected to a link. 
* **driver** - defines the link driver to be used. Currently supported drivers are **veth, bridge, macvlan**. When driver is not specified, default **bridge** driver is used. The following limitations apply:
  * **macvlan** driver will require a mandatory **driver_opts** object described below
  * **veth** driver is talking directly to netlink (no libnetwork involved) and making changes to namespaces
* **driver_opts** - optional object containing driver options as required by Docker's libnetwork. Currently only used for macvlan's parent interface definition

Each link endpoint is encoded as "DeviceName:InterfaceName:IPPrefix" with the following contraints:

* **DeviceName** determines which docker image is going to be used by (case-insensitive) matching of the following strings:
  * **host** - [alpine-host][alpine-host] image is going to be used
  * **cvp** - [cvp](https://github.com/networkop/docker-topo/tree/master/topo-extra-files/cvp) image is going to be used
  * **veos** - Arista vEOS image built according to the procedure described [here](https://github.com/networkop/docker-topo/blob/master/topo-extra-files/veos/README.md)
  * **vmx** - Juniper vMX image built with [vrnetlab][vrnetlab]
  * **csr** - Cisco CSR1000v image built with [vrnetlab][vrnetlab]
  * **xrv** - Cisco IOS XRv image built with [vrnetlab][vrnetlab]
  * For anything else Arista cEOS image will be used 
* **InterfaceName** must match the exact name of the interface you expect to see inside a container. For example if you expect to connect a link to DeviceA interface eth0, endpoint definition should be "DeviceA:eth0"
* **IPPrefix** - Optional parameter that works **ONLY** for [alpine-host][alpine-host] devices and will attempt to configure a provided IP prefix inside a container.

## Bridge vs veth driver caveats

Both bridge and veth driver have their own set of caveats. Keep them in mind when choosing a driver:

| Features | bridge | veth |
|--------|------|------|
| multipoint links | supported | not supported |
| sudo privileges | not required | required | 
| docker modifications | requires [patched][1] docker deamon | uses standard docker daemon |
| L2 multicast | only LLDP | supported | 
 
You can mix both **bridge** and **veth** drivers in the same topology, however make sure that **bridge** driver links always come first, followed by the **veth** links. For example:

```
VERSION: 2
driver: veth

links:
  - endpoints: ["Leaf1:eth1", "Leaf2:eth1"]
    driver: 'bridge'
  - endpoints: ["Leaf1:eth2", "Leaf2:eth2"]
  - endpoints: ["Leaf1:eth3", "Leaf2:eth3"]
```


## (Optional) Global variables
Along with the mandatory `link` array, there are a number of options that can be specified to override some of the default settings. Below are the list of options with their default values:

```yaml
VERSION: 1  # Topology file version. Accepts [1|2]
CEOS_IMAGE: ceos:latest # cEOS docker image name
CONF_DIR: './config' # Config directory to store cEOS startup configuration files
PUBLISH_BASE: 8000 # Publish cEOS ports starting from this number
OOB_PREFIX: '192.168.100.0/24' # Only used when link contains CVP. This prefix is assinged to CVP's eth1
PREFIX: 'CEOS-LAB' # This will default to a topology filename (without .yml extension)
driver: None
```

All of the capitalised global variables can also be provided as environment variables with the following priority:

1. Global variables defined in a topology file
2. Global variables from environment variables
3. Defaults

The final **driver** variable can be used to specify the default link driver for **ALL** links at once. This can be used to create all links with non-default **veth** type drivers:

```yaml
VERSION: 2
driver: veth
links:
  - endpoints: ["host1:eth1", "host2:eth1"]
  - endpoints: ["host1:eth2", "host3:eth1"]
```


There should be several examples in the `./topo-extra-files/examples` directory

## (Optional) Exposing arbitrary ports

By default, `PUBLISH_BASE` will expose internal HTTPS (443/tcp) port of a container. It is possible to expose any number of internal ports for each container by defining `PUBLISH_BASE` in the following way:

```yaml
PUBLISH_BASE:
  443/tcp: None # Will expose inside 443 to a random outside port
  22/tcp: 2000 # All containers will get their ports exposed starting from outside port 2000
  161/tcp: [127.0.0.1, 1600] # Similar to the above but only exposes ports on the defined local IP address
```

**Note:** topology file must have at least one interface of type **bridge** in order for PUBLISH_BASE to work.

## (Optional) Saving and archiving network topologies

By default, `docker-topo` will pick up any files located in the `CONF_DIR` and, if the filename matches the `PREFIX_DEVICENAME`, will mount it inside the container as `/mnt/flash/startup-config`.

When the topology is running, there's a way to easily save the output of "show run" from each device inside the `CONF_DIR` to make them available on next reboot:

```
$ docker-topo -s topology.yml
Config directory exists, existing files may be overwritten. Continue? [y/n]:y
INFO:__main__:All configs saved in ./config
```

Archive option creates a `tar.gz` file with the `CONF_DIR` directory and the topology YAML file

```
$ docker-topo -a topology.yml
INFO:__main__:Archive file topo.tar.gz created
$ tar -tvf topo.tar.gz 
drwxr-xr-x root/root         0 2018-09-14 11:53 config/
-rw-r--r-- null/null       660 2018-09-11 15:08 topology.yml

```

## (Optional) User-defined docker images
It is possible to create topology with arbitrary docker images. One such example is the [openstack topology](https://github.com/networkop/docker-topo/blob/master/topo-extra-files/examples/v2/openstack.yml). Whenever a `CUSTOM_IMAGE` dictionary present, any device names that did not match against the well-known images (e.g. cEOS, vEOS, Host, VMX, CSR etc.), will be matched against the keys of this dictionary and, if match is found, the corresponding value will be used as an image. So in case the topology file has:

```yaml
CUSTOM_IMAGE:
  search_key: docker_image
```

The `docker-topo` image matching logic will try to see if `search_key in device_name.lower()` and if True, will build a `Generic` device type with `self.image == docker_image`.


# Example 1 - Creating a 2-node topology interconnected directly with veth links (without config)

```text
+------+             +------+
|      |et1+-----+et2|      |
|cEOS 1|             |cEOS 2|
|      |et2+-----+et1|      |
+------+             +------+
```

```bash
sudo docker-topo --create topo-extra-files/examples/v2/2-node.yml
```

# Example 2 - Creating a 3-node topology using the default docker bridge driver (with config)
```text
+------+             +------+

```bash

# List and connect to devices

# docker exec -it 3-node_cEOS-1 Cli

```

# Destroy a topology

```bash
docker-topo --destroy topo-extra-files/examples/3-node.yml
```

# Troubleshooting

* If you get the following error, try renaming the topology filename to a string [shorter than 15 characters](https://github.com/svinota/pyroute2/issues/452)

  ```
  pyroute2.netlink.exceptions.NetlinkError: (34, 'Numerical result out of range')
  ```

* CVP can't connect to cEOS devices - make sure that CVP is attached with at least two interfaces. The first one is always for external access and the second one if always for device management
