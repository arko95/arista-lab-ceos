The Python Client for eAPI
==========================

The Python Client for eAPI (pyeapi) is a native Python library wrapper around
Arista EOS eAPI.  It provides a set of Python language bindings for configuring
Arista EOS nodes.

The Python library can be used to communicate with EOS either locally
(on-box) or remotely (off-box). It uses a standard INI-style configuration file
to specify one or more nodes and connection profiles.

The pyeapi library also provides an API layer for building native Python
objects to interact with the destination nodes. The API layer is a convenient
implementation for working with the EOS configuration and is extensible for
developing custom implementations.

This library is freely provided to the open source community for building
robust applications using Arista EOS. Support is provided as best effort
through Github issues.
